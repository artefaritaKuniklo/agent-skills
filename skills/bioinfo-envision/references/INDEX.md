# ENVISION Standards — Data Analysis Guidelines v5.0

> Data Analysis Department Standards (v5.0, November 2025)

## Overview

These are comprehensive analytical standards and best practices for bioinformatics projects. The standards are organized by analysis category and cover data processing, statistical methods, quality control, and reporting requirements.

## Table of Contents

1. [Data Processing Guidelines](data-processing.md)
2. [Differential Expression Analysis](differential-analysis.md)
3. [Co-expression & Network Analysis](network-analysis.md)
4. [Machine Learning & Prediction Models](machine-learning.md)
5. [Enrichment & Pathway Analysis](enrichment-analysis.md)
6. [Single-Cell & Advanced Methods](single-cell-analysis.md)
7. [Special Considerations](special-cases.md)

## Key Principles

### Analyst Responsibilities

- **Project Ownership**: Analysts bear full responsibility for project outcomes from assignment to completion, ensuring professional accuracy, timely delivery, and reproducible results.
- **Proactive Problem Solving**: When encountering issues, analysts should actively resolve them (e.g., literature research, consulting colleagues, adjusting analysis plans).

### General Best Practices

- Document all analysis decisions and parameters
- Verify sample metadata and annotation files before analysis
- Perform quality control checks (PCA, boxplots, heatmaps)
- Maintain reproducibility through seed setting and version tracking
- Provide supporting literature and references for any non-standard thresholds
- Keep clear records of all intermediate results for audit trails
